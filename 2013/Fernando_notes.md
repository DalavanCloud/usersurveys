Fernando's notes - 2013 survey
==============================

Suggestions for what we might try to find out next time:

- Ask about different kinds of education: self directed learning, MOOCs,
  classroom use.
- Ask students vs. educators
- Do the analysis in a notebook? (TK: Google forms gives me most of the charts
  for free)
- Installers: explicitly list Anaconda and Canopy to track those separately?
- Which online hosted notebooks are people using? Wakari, SageMathCloud, GraphLab,
  Koding, ...
- Ask users for URLs of notable projects they want to share.
- Reproducible papers and books?
- Complete course materials they've either authored or used as learners?
