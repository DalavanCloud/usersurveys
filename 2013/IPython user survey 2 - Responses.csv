  b) better navigation in the notebook (sort of outline or table of contents, at top or in sidepane?)

- More official way of promoting, listing, installing, .. extensions for the notebook (maybe even a ui dialog where you can with checkboxes (de)activate certain extensions if you have installed e.g. ipython-contrib repo)

- Better integration with sphinx documentation

- Pure R kernel (not the magics) would also be interesting. The notebook really outperforms things like knitr/Rstudio when it comes to interactivity between code and output (notebook is dynamic while writing).

Actually, among the people who install anaconda, I see a majority of windows users, choosing to use spyder, instead of the notebook. Again, I think it is an interface problem.

Initially, low-level processing chain with dedicated c++ software can not be avoided (lots of data, really!). Afterwards, I use ipython for pretty much everything-- to try out new algorithm, test ideas, make plots, document my work-flow, collaborate with fellow scientists. A huge subset of our c++ application has python-bindings written for it, making using ipython a no-brainer. 

I'm pretty much addicted to the notebooks. Being able to go back to my work, tweak a few numbers, re-run the kernel and watch new plots being made makes me happy. Inline plotting means I'm automatically documenting my work as I write code. ",1,2.7,"Online documentation, Stackoverflow, Source code",Thank you for IPython!
